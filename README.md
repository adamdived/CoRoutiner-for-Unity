> TinyTweener for Unity
I wrote this class because i needed something like iTween or DOTween but but without installing any external library for my project. TinyTweener is quick and faster, especially if you need precise value transitioning. Also offer many options of use for different conditions (Transform control, float values changes, light control, audio control etc).
